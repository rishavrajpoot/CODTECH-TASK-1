OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 

PROJECT:QUIZ GAME ,a simple quiz game that presents multiple-choice questions to the
user. The game should keep track of the user's score and provide feedback
based on their answers.

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this project is to create a simple quiz game in C language that presents multiple-choice questions to the user, keeps track of the user's score, and provides immediate feedback based on their answers.

KEY ACTIVITY: 

Question Handling: Define questions with multiple-choice options and correct answers.             
User Interaction: Display questions to the user, prompt for answers, and validate input.          
Score Tracking: Calculate and display the user's score based on their answers.                    
Feedback Mechanism: Provide immediate feedback on whether each answer is correct or incorrect.  

									
TECGNOLOGIES USED:C Programming Language: Used for coding the quiz game logic.                
Standard Input/Output  
            
FUNCTIONS: printf, scanf for displaying content and accepting user input.         
Arrays and Structures: Used to store and manage quiz questions, options, and correct answers.        
Control Structures: for loop for iterating through questions and if-else statements for validation and scoring.                

KEY INSIGHTS:

Data Structures: Utilize arrays and structures to organize and manage quiz data effectively.            
Input Handling: Implement input validation to ensure correct user interaction.                       
Feedback Mechanism: Provide immediate feedback to enhance user engagement and learning.                
Scoring System: Develop a simple scoring mechanism to track user performance throughout the quiz.
Efficiency: Utilizes arrays and loops to handle multiple questions efficiently.                  
User Experience: Provides clear prompts and immediate feedback to enhance user engagement.                 
Scalability: Easily expandable by adding more questions to the quiz array.                         
Education: Simple structure can be used for educational purposes, testing knowledge retention, or for fun quizzes.                                                                                  


This project serves as a foundational example of how to create interactive command-line applications in C and showcases basic principles of programming logic, data structures, and user interaction.
